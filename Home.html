      PJ Panda is a rapper who makes clean, fun, and educational music for kids that parents also enjoy. 
      Oftentimes, rap music contains content that is not family friendly and the alternatives to children's rap music 
      is either outdated or just not good. PJ Panda was created to bridge the gap between culturally relevant sounding music 
      and content that the entire family can enjoy.

      PJ's Alphabet School is an educational children's variety show (found on PJ Panda's YouTube channel). Through both 
      animated and live action skits, kids are presented with real world situations and shown appropriate responses with 
      possible outcomes. They are taught life skills, good habits, and positive morals. Videos are often posted weekly and 
      each episode focuses on a different theme critical to early childhood development through young adulthood.
